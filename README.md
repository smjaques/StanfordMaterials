# StanfordMaterials

This is a website designed for students in the Stanford Product Realization Lab.

It has several features to help aid students in their designing process:

	-- to start from a process

	-- to start from a material property

	-- to explore the properties of a certain material

All features are designed to help a student determine the correct material for

their project, while learnined about it's properties as they go.
